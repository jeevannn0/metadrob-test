## Approach Of The Project:

The approach in simple words is like i mad 2 files in the src folder those are canvascomponents and another one is controls .To get the 3d odels i used the threejs lib dri(@react-three/drei) to get those models and add the spices like shadow rotation etc.. as you said in the task. And in the conrols file i create the toggle button to show and hide the models and slide bar to set the roatation speed for the objects. yeah i think thats it And i ahve use threejs for little style up the components.



# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
